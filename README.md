# slim-cms
## A very basic but strong CMS built on PHP Slim, Angular JS, MySQL

1. Slim: https://www.slimframework.com/
2. Angular JS: https://angular.io/
3. MySQL
4. Restangular: https://github.com/2muchcoffeecom/ng2-restangular
5. Angular UI Router: https://ui-router.github.io/ng2/

### The Story
    I had a wordpress website for a friend. The server got hacked. When I investigated the culprit was the WordPress. I felt bad. I needed a very basic but secure CMS. So I started working on it.
   
### The Basic Idea
    Let angular takes care of routing, Slim will serve as API. So if you want to build an app you might not not to change a lot.
